    <h1>Welcome to swarm.hiveeyes.org</h1>
    swarm.hiveeyes.org is a bee monitoring data collection platform voluntarily
    operated by the beekeeper community. It runs on open source software.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        swarm.hiveeyes.org is the data collection hub for the independent
        <a href="http://open-hive.org/">Open Hive</a>,
        <a href="https://hiveeyes.org/">Hiveeyes</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/dazz/hivemonitor">Hive Monitor</a>
        bee monitoring projects.

        Our shared
        <a href="https://swarm.hiveeyes.org/docs/">Hiveeyes system documentation</a>
        environment is trying to keep up with our work.
        <i>Feel welcome to <a href="mailto:hiveeyes-dev [aet] ideensyndikat.org">join us</a>.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        The platform has the primary role of a stable integration testbed during construction times and
        will be continuously monitored and maintained to ensure it's always up and running to be
        available to everybody working with it.
        We also do nightly backups of the whole system.

        If you experience any malfunction, please do not hesitate to contact us, our email address is in the footer of this page.
        In order to join the maintenance team, just send your SSH public keys.
    </p>


    <h2>Demo</h2>
    Hand-crafted Grafana dashboards for demonstration purposes

        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Services</h2>
    The systems are offering these services to the public:
    <blockquote>
        mqtt://swarm.hiveeyes.org
        <br/>
        <a href="https://swarm.hiveeyes.org/grafana/">https://swarm.hiveeyes.org/grafana/</a>
    </blockquote>

    The credentials for accessing Grafana are:
    <blockquote>
        username: hiveeyes<br/>
        password: Efocmunk
    </blockquote>

    Accessing the MQTT bus is not secured and unrestricted during beta.

                    It's really just a plain flat JSON object, mapping field names to measurement values.
                    Go ahead and send anything you like.

                <li>
                    We usually prefer bunches of multiple measurement values, but sending them discrete one by one
                    is perfectly fine as well.

    <h2>Quickstart</h2>

            tells you how to send measurement values to the "testdrive" channel
        </li>
        <li>

            <a href="https://swarm.hiveeyes.org/grafana/dashboard/db/testdrive">testdrive dashboard</a>

    <h2>Policy</h2>
    Multi-tenancy and fair-use
    <ul>
        <li>
            The platform is designed with multi-tenancy in mind. Just drop us an email to register
            your own (sub-)domains with us, e.g. beehive-monitor.example.org.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            Please regulate your measurement frequency to prevent overloading the platform.
            We are storing data for the long run.
            Taking one measurement per five minutes should be enough, don't go further than
            one measurement per minute.
            However, there is no throttling in place right now, so feel free to stress-test
            the platform (moderately and not permanently) in the "testdrive" namespace.
        </li>
    </ul>
