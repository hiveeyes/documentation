Terms

Please read this information when using the Hiveeyes public services.


Disclaimer
==========
When using our public services, the terms and conditions
of the :ref:`hiveeyes-liability-disclaimer` apply.


Operations
==========
The platform will be continuously monitored and maintained to ensure maximum
availability. We also perform nightly backups of the whole system, so data
stored in the system should be reasonably safe.
If you experience any malfunction or have suggestions for further improvements,
please do not hesitate to `contact us <Hiveeyes email_>`_.

Read the :ref:`platform-operations` notes to gain insight about how the platform is operated.


Fair-use policy
===============
Please regulate your measurement frequency to prevent overloading the platform.
We are storing data for the long run.
Taking one measurement per five minutes should be enough, don't go further than
one measurement per minute.
However, there is no throttling in place right now, so feel free to stress-test
the platform (moderately and not permanently) in the "testdrive" namespace.
