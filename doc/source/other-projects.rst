Introduction
************
As our project is not the first one in this field, we would
like to share links to the other popular projects around.

We want to encourage the growth of an open ecosystem based
on collaborative best-of-breed efforts while always leaving
room for individual setups.

We strongly foster the "standing on the shoulders of giants"
philosophy and as our DIY community is still small, nobody
should be reinventing the wheel. Some of the projects listed
already are building upon the ideas, efforts and technologies
of each other.

Have fun browsing this list of great projects,
they are listed in order of appearance and categorized
into scientific, educational, open source / do-it-yourself
and commercial ones.
