Introduction
************
As our project is not the first one in this field, we would
like to share links to other popular projects having similar
goals in doing research about environmental
issues leading to colony collapse disorder
and to make the job of beekeepers easier.

We want to encourage the growth of an open ecosystem based
on collaborative best-of-breed efforts while always leaving
room for individual setups.

We strongly foster the "standing on the shoulders of giants"
philosophy and as our DIY community is still small, nobody
should be reinventing the wheel. Some of the projects listed
already are building upon the ideas, efforts and technologies
of each other.

Have fun browsing this list of great projects,
they are listed in order of appearance and categorized
into scientific, educational, open source / do-it-yourself
and commercial ones. If you know others, don't hesitate to
`ping us <Hiveeyes email_>`_ about them.

The people at http://colonymonitoring.com/ do a similar job by
aggregating pointers to both commercial and homemade monitoring
solutions.

Scientific and educational projects
***********************************


Umweltspäher
============

behavior of the honeybee and the environmental impact of neonicotinoids on bee colony
behavior at the Free University of Berlin. Around since 2000.

HoneyBeeNet
===========
The famous HoneyBeeNet project of NASA inspired many of us with the idea
of creating a national data collection network for gaining insights
into environmental conditions, nectar flow and bee forage information.
Around since 2006. Based/originated in Maryland and Delaware, U.S.

HOBOS - HOneyBee Online Studies
===============================
The HOBOS (HOneyBee Online Studies) project is an interactive educational project
initiated and developed since 2006 by Prof. Dr. Jürgen Tautz from the University of Würzburg,
based in Franconia, northern Bavaria, Germany.
After their 10 years of history, they have a large presence,
online and in the real world. It is totally worth having a look at it.
