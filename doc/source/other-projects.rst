Introduction
************
As our project is not the first one in this field, we would
like to share links to other popular projects having similar
goals in doing research about environmental
issues leading to colony collapse disorder
and to make the job of beekeepers easier.

We want to encourage the growth of an open ecosystem based
on collaborative best-of-breed efforts while always leaving
room for individual setups.

We strongly foster the "standing on the shoulders of giants"
philosophy and as our DIY community is still small, nobody
should be reinventing the wheel. Some of the projects listed
already are building upon the ideas, efforts and technologies
of each other.

Have fun browsing this list of great projects,
they are listed in order of appearance and categorized
into scientific, educational, open source / do-it-yourself
and commercial ones. If you know others, don't hesitate to
`ping us <Hiveeyes email_>`_ about them.

The people at http://colonymonitoring.com/ do a similar job by
aggregating pointers to both commercial and homemade monitoring
solutions.

The Bee Laboratory
==================
The Bee Laboratory project monitors the behaviour of honeybees in urban surroundings. 
Beekeepers, scientists and artists examine the bee colonies in our rooftop gardens,
our open air laboratories. We study the distributed intelligence of the honeybees:
their behaviour, ecology and sociobiology. We monitor the bees and beehives with all
kinds of eco-technology and we study the colony as a community. We research the
interaction between the different colonies as well as the colonies’ behaviour and
development in relation to the urban environment.

Around since 2009.

insulation to reduce the impact of the cold winter months on bee numbers. Working
in collaboration with a technology company it has integrated scales, thermometer
and humidity sensing equipment linked to the internet to check and monitor the hive
remotely. Over 50 hives have been distributed across the country aiming to make the
life for both bee and beekeeper easier.

==============
This is a mobile application, for Android OS smartphones, which main task is - to turn your
smartphone into a control and measuring instrument that allows you to receive and interpret
acoustic data of  bee colony, in order to understand its condition.
Moreover, it allows obtaining and analyzing these data quickly and with a minimum effort.
The application in its work, uses all possibilities of smartphone as a portable computer,
which can collect and process data. The device receives acoustic data from the built-in
microphone, or wired microphone or Bluetooth headset operating in a microphone mode.
APIVOX AUDITOR was created in collaboration between engineers and beekeepers, so it provides
the configuration and functions that reduce errors and distortions of measurement results on
the one hand, and makes the use of device simple and effective for beekeepers on the other.  ​

Around since 2016.
